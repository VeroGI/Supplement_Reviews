**Introduction:** A company dedicated to the online sale of nutritional supplements aims to thoroughly understand the opinions of its customers, especially those who expressed dissatisfaction with their purchases. This aspect is crucial, since negative reviews can translate into significant financial losses.

**Objective:** The main objective is to use the information extracted from reviews to improve customers' shopping experience. The intention is to avoid the loss of existing customers and win back those who have been lost.

**Hypothesis:** It is hypothesized that the star rating of a review can be predicted from its title. Furthermore, it is postulated that identifying the most frequent words in negative reviews will provide valuable insights into the aspects that require improvement.

**Methodology:** A web scraping process was carried out to compile a data set that includes all of the company's reviews posted on Trustpilot. 
Once the dataset was obtained, preprocessing and exploratory analysis of the data was carried out and different machine learning models were built, using oversampling techniques for unbalanced classes. Finally, the models were compared and the best one was selected considering not only the metrics but the potential economic benefit for the company.
In turn, the most frequent words in the negative reviews were analyzed to propose actions to improve the service provided to the customer.

Some libraries used: BeautifulSoup, Pandas, Numpy, Sklearn, Matplotlib, TensorFlow and SciPy.
